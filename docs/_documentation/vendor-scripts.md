Concrete ships with a few JavaScript libraries. These are minified into the `assets/vendor.js` file, or if you are working in Slate they are in individual files in `src/scripts/vendor/`.

#### [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/)
Modernizr is used to add features to older browsers and different devices. We have included a lightweight custom build of Modernizr that only includes the features that we require. This custom build can be viewed and modified [here](https://modernizr.com/download/?-csstransforms-csstransforms3d-flexbox-placeholder-svg-touchevents-domprefixes-prefixes-setclasses-testallprops-testprop-teststyles).

#### [jQuery 2.2.3](https://jquery.com/)
I'm sure this doesn't need any introduction. We include jQuery because it saves time and most projects will use it.

#### [Handlebars 4.0.10](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
Handlebars is a 'liquid-like' javascript templating library. We include it because Cartfox uses Handlebars to render the cart but there are heaps of other uses for it in an online store.

#### [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
As per the Lodash website: Lodash makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
Lodashâ€™s modular methods are great for:

Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
Manipulating & testing values
Creating composite functions

We use Lodash in some of concrete functions (`concrete.Sections`, `concrete.Product`, `concrete.Variants`) because it makes things faster (in the browser), and easier to maintain.

#### [Concrete Popups](https://github.com/Elkfox/Concrete-Popups)
Modals and popups are used so frequently in e-commerce websites that we developed our own flavour because we weren't that impressed with the alternatives. This lives in the vendor scripts because it is a dependency of the framework - although it doesn't need to be if you choose otherwise.

There is some basic documentation [here](#concrete-popups).

#### [Cartfox](https://github.com/Elkfox/Cartfox)
Cartfox is our very own ajax cart, lightweight and integrated to concrete but is easily adaptable to any theme.

There is some basic documentation [here](#cart).
